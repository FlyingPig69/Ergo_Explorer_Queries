# Ergo_Explorer_Queries

Very much WIP!

Query will pull a list of addresses who are staking on ergopad contracts. 
It's currently pulling one row per staking key, but you can pivot in excel to make a summary table.

I'll add it to the query itself when I learn how :)

If querying ergopad staked tokens it's currently pulling 5k+ keys...suspect it includes burnt tokens, if anyone can help, feel free.
EGIO,Paideia and Neta works fine.
